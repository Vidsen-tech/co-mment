    "workshops.title": "Collaging Workshop",
    "workshops.description": "This workshop is based on the principle of \"collaging,\" which served as the starting point for our original work, “…, and the exits are even smaller.” Inspired by the visual art technique of collage, we build a dance vocabulary where the body and the space are treated as a canvas. Using the principles of collaging, we create a performance that explores the boundaries between movement, space, and rhythm.\n\nThrough improvisational tasks, we explore movement qualities and physical tools that provoke individual creativity on the theme of collaging. The emphasis is on building body awareness within personal and collective spaces. Working in pairs and groups, participants are introduced to fundamental mechanisms of collaging. This approach is characterized by fragmented and precise movement, revealing the unique rhythm produced by the body. The workshop concludes with individual creative tasks that allow participants to reflect on and apply the knowledge and tools they have acquired in their own way.\n\nWe invite you to this workshop to explore the boundaries of your movement and open space for new dance creativity.",
